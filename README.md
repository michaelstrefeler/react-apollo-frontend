# react-apollo-frontend
Frontend side of graphql-js repo, containing server code in it

## About
I made the frontend of my hackernews clone by following a tutorial on howtographql.com
The code in the server directory is not the same as the code in [graphql-js repo](https://github.com/michaelstrefeler/graphql-js) because I needed to change some things so the frontend and backend would work together.
